❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` but these variables are not defined within the function's scope, nor
are they passed as arguments. This will result in an error or unexpected behavior.
* ❌ There are no input parameters defined for the function, limiting its reusability and flexibility.
* ❌ There is no error handling for when a or b is undefined.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return 'Error: Both arguments must be numbers.';
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear what the function needs to operate.
* ✔ Includes a check to ensure that both `a` and `b` are numbers, providing error handling for invalid inputs.
* ✔ Returns an error message when the inputs are not numbers, improving the function's robustness.
